## üîß Development Workflow

### Starting Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start dev server (with Turbopack for faster builds)
yarn dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Adding New Blog Posts

1. **Create the markdown file:**
   ```bash
   # Create in content/blog/
   touch content/blog/your-post-slug.md
   ```

2. **Add frontmatter and content:**
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: "Your Post Title"
   date: "2025-01-XX"
   excerpt: "Brief description for listings"
   tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
   published: true
   ---
   
   Your markdown content here...
   ```

3. **The system automatically:**
   - Generates the route `/blog/your-post-slug`
   - Adds it to the blog listing
   - Handles SEO metadata

### Adding Demo Pages

1. **Create a new route:**
   ```bash
   mkdir src/app/demos/your-demo-name
   touch src/app/demos/your-demo-name/page.tsx
   ```

2. **Build your component:**
   ```tsx
   export default function YourDemo() {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Your Demo</h1>
         {/* Your demo content */}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

## üìù Tutorial: Creating Your First Blog Post

Let's create a blog post about Cursor IDE! Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Set up the blog infrastructure (if not done)
The blog system should already be set up, but if you need to create it:
- Blog listing page at `/blog`
- Dynamic routing for individual posts
- Markdown processing

### Step 2: Create your blog post file
```bash
# Create the content directory and file
mkdir -p content/blog
touch content/blog/cursor-ide-agent-mode-review.md
```

### Step 3: Write your blog post
Add this content to `content/blog/cursor-ide-agent-mode-review.md`:

```markdown
---
title: "Cursor IDE Agent Mode: Why I'm Super Impressed"
date: "2025-01-XX"
excerpt: "After using Cursor IDE for months, here's why its agent mode has completely transformed my development workflow"

# Cursor IDE Agent Mode: Why I'm Super Impressed

I've been using Cursor IDE for a while now, and I have to say - I'm genuinely impressed. As someone who's tried various AI-powered development tools, Cursor's agent mode stands out in ways that have fundamentally changed how I approach coding.

## What Makes Cursor Different

### 1. Context Awareness
Unlike other AI tools that work in isolation, Cursor understands your entire codebase. When I ask it to implement a feature, it:
- Knows the existing patterns in my code
- Understands the project structure
- Maintains consistency with my coding style

### 2. Agent Mode is a Game Changer
The agent mode isn't just autocomplete on steroids - it's like having a senior developer pair programming with you who:
- Can read and understand your entire project
- Suggests architectural improvements
- Implements complex features across multiple files
- Follows your existing conventions

## Real-World Example

Recently, I needed to add authentication to a Next.js project. Instead of spending hours researching and implementing, I simply described what I needed:

"Add authentication with NextAuth.js, including Google OAuth, protected routes, and session management"

Cursor agent mode:
1. Analyzed my existing project structure
2. Installed the necessary dependencies
3. Created all the required configuration files
4. Set up protected routes
5. Added proper TypeScript types
6. Even updated my existing components to handle auth state

What would have taken me 3-4 hours was done in 15 minutes, and the implementation followed best practices.

## The Learning Experience

One of the most impressive aspects is how Cursor explains its decisions. When it makes changes, it often includes comments explaining:
- Why it chose a particular approach
- How the implementation fits with existing code
- Potential gotchas or considerations

This turns coding sessions into learning experiences.

## Areas Where It Excels

1. **Rapid Prototyping**: From idea to working code incredibly fast
2. **Refactoring**: Safely transforms code across multiple files
3. **Documentation**: Generates comprehensive, accurate docs
4. **Testing**: Creates meaningful test suites that actually test important behavior
5. **Debugging**: Quickly identifies and fixes issues

## Minor Limitations

While I'm impressed, it's not perfect:
- Sometimes overthinks simple problems
- Occasionally suggests overly complex solutions
- Still needs human oversight for architectural decisions

## Bottom Line

Cursor IDE with agent mode has genuinely transformed my development workflow. It's not just about writing code faster - it's about thinking at a higher level, focusing on problem-solving rather than syntax, and learning better patterns along the way.

If you're on the fence about trying it, I'd highly recommend giving it a shot. The agent mode alone makes it worth the switch.

## What's Next?

I'm planning to explore more advanced features like:
- Custom prompts for project-specific patterns
- Integration with my existing workflow tools
- Team collaboration features

Stay tuned for more posts about development tools and productivity!

### Step 4: Test your post
1. Start the dev server: `yarn dev`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/blog`
